# Simplified DES Encryption Algorithm

This project was completed by me and a partner in the Introduction to Computer Systems class at the University of San Diego.

The file which contains the encryption code is 'simplified_des.c'.

In this file the Feistal function has been coded. This function uses masking, shifting and bitwise instructions to encrypt data.

The algorithm also creates keys for encryption rounds, which have their own method of being generated.
